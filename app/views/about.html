      I'm just the guy who currently manages the coding behind the game,
      and implemeting the mechanics, so if there is a bug or something related,
      you already know who to blame, and so do the team (but please, have mercy).
      Also I'm also the guy who right now is designing this page, so if you think
      it looks ugly, let me know, after all this is the first time I have done
      a webpage without using assist tools like, you know blogger and all those
      stuffs that makes everything automatically.

    <h3>Goombazo</h3>
    <p>
      My name is Alex, but I am also known as Goombazo.
      Why? Well, it's a long story (actually, it isn't).
      I'm currently the team's composer, and thus, I am working on the soundtrack,
      along with the sound effects, for "Leave a Tip".
      This is my first official game project, so I'm kinda nervous,
      but excited at the same time. I'm working very hard to ensure that every song and sound sounds great.
      <br>
      Fun fact: I'm the only one in the group who doesn't drink beer.
      <br>
      I really like to hear music, so since we created the team,
      I was really interested on composing for our games, even though I had never composed at all.
      I learned a lot of things while I was composing my first song, and after showing my progress to my friends,
      they liked it, and decided that I would compose all of the songs.
      I really hope you guys enjoy the music in the game.
      Maybe I'll show you guys some samples throughout the game's development.

      I'm the Keeper Team's lead artist,
      writer and character designer. As you can probably guess from my nickname,
      I'm a huge Cave Story fan, the game being one of my main inspirations for becoming a Game Dev.</p>
